I really enjoyed your (second) conversation with Anne Simon
on TWiV 512.

Regarding public perception of transgenic crops,
it is worth noting that Bayer acquired Monsanto this year.
Low commodity prices
have been driving consolidation in the industry
(see also ChemChina-Syngenta and DuPont-Dow).
It should be interesting to see
if the disappearance of the name "Monsanto" affects perception at all.

In a historical echo,
the European Union Court of Justice
recently ruled that CRISPR-gene-edited plants
will need to go through the same stringent approval process
as transgenic plants.
(See for example [[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05814-6][this news piece]] by Ewen Callaway.)
This decisions runs counter to the regulatory environment
that is emerging in the US,
where the USDA has indicated
that a number of gene-edited crops
will not be regulated as transgenic.

Plum pox virus
and two geminiviruses
are on the [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2011.00752.x][list of "top" plant viruses]]
that Dickson picked back on TWiV 274.
Also included on the list is Potato virus Y,
the namesake for the genus /Potyvirus/
and family /Potyviridae/.
