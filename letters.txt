** Perception of transgenic crops (read on TWiV 514; #2 on [[http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-514-letters/][letters page]])
# [2018-09-30 14:56]

I really enjoyed your (second) conversation with Anne Simon
on TWiV 512.

Regarding public perception of transgenic crops,
it is worth noting that Bayer acquired Monsanto this year.
Low commodity prices
have been driving consolidation in the industry
(see also ChemChina-Syngenta and DuPont-Dow).
It should be interesting to see
if the disappearance of the name "Monsanto" affects perception at all.

In a historical echo,
the European Union Court of Justice
recently ruled that CRISPR-gene-edited plants
will need to go through the same stringent approval process
as transgenic plants.
(See for example [[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05814-6][this news piece]] by Ewen Callaway.)
This decisions runs counter to the regulatory environment
that is emerging in the US,
where the USDA has indicated
that a number of gene-edited crops
will not be regulated as transgenic.

Plum pox virus
and two geminiviruses
are on the [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2011.00752.x][list of "top" plant viruses]]
that Dickson picked back on TWiV 274.
Also included on the list is <i>pot</i>ato virus /Y/,
the namesake for the genus /Potyvirus/
and family /Potyviridae/.

** Leafhopper- and treehopper-transmitted viruses (read on TWiV 539; top of [[http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-539-letters/][letters page]])
Regarding Dickson's pick of the week on TWiV 537
(starting at 1:29:02):
it looks like leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) are closely related to
but distinct from treehoppers (Membracidae).

As briefly noted in the National Geographic piece,
treehoppers transmit fewer plant viruses:
two are known,
tomato pseudo-curly top virus
and grapevine red blotch virus.
Both are ssDNA geminiviruses,
in the family which you featured on TWiV 512 (with Anne Simon).

Leafhoppers also transmit several economically important geminiviruses
(see the ICTV family profile),
as well as other viruses
such as the reovirus
featured in the paper and cover image that Dickson described.

Thanks to Dickson for excellent back-to-back picks!
